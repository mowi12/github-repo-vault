description: "SirixDB is an embeddable, temporal, evolutionary database system, which uses an append-only approach to store immutable revisions. It keeps the full history of each resource. Every commit stores a space-efficient snapshot through structural sharing. It is log-structured and never overwrites data. SirixDB uses a novel page-level versioning approach."
